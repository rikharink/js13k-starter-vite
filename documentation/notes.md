# TODO
- Change the pallete system to something more generic / re-usable over games without needing large changes in the code
- Button coloring doesn't seem to be working anymore
- Clicking the buttons seems weird, think this has something to do with scaling? 
- particles? <https://gpfault.net/posts/webgl2-particles.txt.html>
